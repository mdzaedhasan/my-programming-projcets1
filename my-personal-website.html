    <h1> Winter Morning 
<P> 
    The winter morning Is a chilly morning of summertime. Sometimes, it dews. The environment is dull arid dismal, covered with mist and fog, and everything appears hazy. In the distance, an individual can barely see and detect items. The animals lose their spirits. They look sullen and distressed. People today put on various kinds of warm clothes to protect themselves from the cold. Older men and children tremble in the winter. They collect straw to warm themselves and put fire in several places. Altogether, people don’t feel like leaving the mattress too early. They awaken late in the winter morning when the sun peeps through the pall of mist. The signature of these sun-rays makes the birds and beast content. Farmers awaken early in the morning and going to the area to begin their day’s work. The fog and fog of the rising sun evaporate, and folks remove the feeling of winter to meet their daily duties. On a winter morning, individuals enjoy various kinds of tasty food Items involving different types of Pithas and Paes ready from date-Juice. I appreciate it very much since It provides us with these sorts of delicious foods. Moreover, in winter vegetables cooked together with fishes is very enjoyable
